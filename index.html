    <h3>Standing on the shoulders of giants</h3>
    <p>When I went off-grid, spookily anticipating the financial meltdown of the late 1980s, little did I realise that I would soon find salve for the psychic wounds inflicted on me by the finance-sector elites I had been serving, via the rickety phone line that made its way up the mountain and through the trees to my cabin deep in the woods.  From there unfolded a world that was the opposite of the one I came from, it was open, sharing and collaborative, the internet found me.  Now I was finally permitted to 'know' the things my former overlords were adamant I shouldn't concern myself with.  How awesome.  A virtual cornucopia for the disillusioned yet curious.</p> <p>I didn't have electricity, but I had access to knowledge.  In the days before social media.  Even better.</p>

    <h3>Something borrowed, something true</h3>
    <p>Obsessively fascinated by all things I could command and control, this inevitably led me to d3/web design and coding, and from then on, design and code I did.  At work, at home, I found creating solutions (for friends, and for work) and delightful things (for me, and for virtual reality customers) to be endlessly satisfying and fun, and still do.</p>
    <p>A little later on in my fantastic journey, I did some formal study - now, if you're inclined to be untrusting of people who can learn by the absorption and trial method, you can breathe again, relieved I hope. I won't say the study wasn't useful, because it was, but lets say it rounded out my knowledge in other areas, far more than it taught me about my core passion. </p>

      <h3>Daily inspiration</h3>
      <p>I'm so thankful that the open, collaborative ethos that was the early internet existed, it continues to educate, inspire and motivate me in my daily work and interactions. </p>
      <p>I'm also thankful for the people I work with who have allowed me to use my talents for good, in spite of what my position description might not have said, and am especially thankful to all those who have advocated for recognition of my contribution, in whatever form that has taken.</p>
   <p>This is just the tip of a deep deep iceberg - I'm storing some of my latest work for posterity on GitHub, apologies if you find it messy, the notes and commented mistakes are like a diary of how it got to where it is.</p>
