    <h3>Treechange, before it was a thing</h3>
    <p>When I quit my job and went off-grid back in the 80s, spookily anticipating the financial meltdown about to temporarily impede the accumulation of wealth of my bosses and cut their number of sailing days, little did I realise that I would soon find salve for the psychic wounds I left the city with via the rickety phone line that made its way up the mountain and through the trees to my cabin deep in the woods. </p><p> As unlikely as it seems, it was from there that I discovered a world that was the opposite of the one I came from -- it was open, sharing and collaborative, if a little wild, the internet found me, and I thus began my exploration of the universe. Now I was at last permitted to 'know' the things my various overlords were adamant I shouldn't concern myself with.  How awesome.  A virtual cornucopia for the disillusioned yet curious.  </p> <p>I didn't have electricity, but I had access to knowledge.  In the days before social media.  Even better.  </p>

    <h3>Something borrowed, something true</h3>
    <p>Obsessively fascinated by all the virtual things I could command and control, this inevitably led me to 3D/web design and coding, and from then on, design and code I did.  At work, at home, I found creating solutions and websites (for friends, and for work) and other delightful things (for me, and for virtual reality customers) to be endlessly satisfying and fun, and I still do.</p>
    <p>A little later on in my fantastic journey, I did some formal study - now, if you're inclined to be untrusting of people who can learn by the absorption and trial method, you can breathe again, relieved I hope. I won't say the study wasn't useful, because it was, but lets say it rounded out my knowledge in other areas, far more than it taught me about my core passion. </p>

      <h3>Daily inspiration</h3>
      <p>I'm so thankful that the open, collaborative ethos that was the early internet existed -- it continues to educate, inspire and motivate me in my daily work and interactions. </p>
        <p>I'm also thankful for the people I've worked with over the years who have allowed me to use my talents for good, in spite of what my position description might not have said, and am especially thankful to all those who have advocated for recognition of my contribution, in whatever form that has taken.</p>
        <p>Wherever possible, I choose not to reinvent the wheel for its own sake, although I note since I started others have reinvented it many times - so many new things to learn, every day.  </p>
 
   <p>This is just the tip of a rather large iceberg - I'm storing some of my latest work for future reference and posterity on GitHub, apologies if you find it messy, I leave in the notes and commented mistakes in a lot of my code to remind me how I got there.  </p>
